@techreport{NTAG216,
abstract = {NTAG213, NTAG215 and NTAG216 have been developed by NXP Semiconductors as standard NFC tag ICs to be used in mass market applications such as retail, gaming and consumer electronics, in combination with NFC devices or NFC compliant Proximity Coupling Devices. NTAG213, NTAG215 and NTAG216 (from now on, generally called NTAG21x) are designed to fully comply to NFC Forum Type 2 Tag (Ref. 2) and ISO/IEC14443 Type A (Ref. 1) specifications. Target applications include Out-of-Home and print media smart advertisement, SoLoMo applications, product authentication, NFC shelf labels, mobile companion tags. Target use cases include Out-of-Home smart advertisement, product authentication, mobile companion tags, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi pairing, electronic shelf labels and business cards. NTAG21x memory can also be segmented to implement multiple applications at the same time. Thanks to the high input capacitance, NTAG21x tag ICs are particularly tailored for applications requiring small footprints, without compromise on performance. Small NFC tags can be more easily embedded into e.g. product labels or electronic devices. The mechanical and electrical specifications of NTAG21x are tailored to meet the requirements of inlay and tag manufacturers.},

@book{Elenkov2015,
abstract = {There are nearly a billion Android devices in use today, and every one is a potential security breach. Love it or hate it, the security of Android-based devices is of major concern to users and developers alike. In "Android Security Internals," author Nikolay Elenkov delves into Android components and subsystems to give you a very deep and complete understanding of the security internals of Android devices. Elenkov's coverage of security topics ranges from package and user management to the details of cryptographic providers and credential storage. "Android Security Internals" is destined to be one book that that all security-minded Android developers will have to have on their bookshelves.},
